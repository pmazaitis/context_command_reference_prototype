ConTeXt Command Reference

# Introduction

This is a project to develop a ConTeXt command reference as a DITA information set. This is a prototype version the reference, including a small subset of the commands to demonstrate how the document set works.

The primary map for this project is:

    context_command_reference.ditamap
    
# Domain

This project is limited to supplying a reference to the command set; the manual presented here is not meant to be used as a tutorial, guide, or other instructional text.

# Audience

This project meant to offer a useful information set to two sets of users:

 * People using ConTeXt who need quick reference to the details of a particular command.
 * People who are developing tools for use with ConTeXt, and need access to a command information set that is suitable for machine processing.
    
# Status

This project is very much a work in progress; the architecture is still in development.
